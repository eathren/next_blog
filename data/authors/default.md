Nolan Braman is a software engineer and a candidate for a masters in computer science at Northeastern University, and is lucky enough to be paid to write TypeScript and Python for a living. His professional interests include visualizing graph networks for supply chain analysis, low latency scalable backend solutions, and AI/ML utilities in stock prediction.

He is connected to his university's blockchain club, where he served as the Director of Technology. In his free time, he likes to find new tea shops, snowboard, surf, and work on his sci-fi novel.

Nolan has worked for three startups in his 4+ year career, and loves to create elegant solutions for complex problems, in a way that doesn't make the next programmer want to pull their hair out.
